[37;41mYour requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.[39;49m

  Problem 1
    - laravel/framework is locked to version v12.41.1 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - laravel/framework v12.41.1 requires league/flysystem-local ^3.25.1 -> satisfiable by league/flysystem-local[3.30.2].
    - league/flysystem-local 3.30.2 requires ext-fileinfo * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's fileinfo extension.

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - C:\php-8.5.2\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-fileinfo` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
You can also try re-running composer require with an explicit version constraint, e.g. "composer require laravel/reverb:*" to figure out if any version is installable, or "composer require laravel/reverb:^2.1" if you know which you need.

[37;41mInstallation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.[39;49m
